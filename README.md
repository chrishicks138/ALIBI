An Android sensor recorder that outputs to CSV format on your 
device in a folder in your home directory called CSV. A use case
for this would be is one were accused of something, one can 
voluntarily provide their own data to prove otherwise.

My inspiration for this idea was from a friend of mine who is a
retired Navy Special Weapons veteran. He helps veterans defend
themselves legally by researching law, so I made this program in
honor of any military veteran experiencing persecution while
homeless.

This is my first serious python programming project.
